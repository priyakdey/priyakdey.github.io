### Disclaimer:

The resume page has custom css, now I had to spend a long time to make them responsive, cause I am a css genius !! I know it does not work on some times, well at this time I dont care (Samsung S8+ and few more). Later on I will be fixing it, if I have time.

So in case your device shows weird overlays or bad css, please put a comment in [this issue](https://github.com/priyakdey/priyakdey.github.io/issues/5).
