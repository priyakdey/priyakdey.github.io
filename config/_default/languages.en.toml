bio = "Software engineer, traveler, and avid photographer, I find my rhythm in the quiet corners of cafes and the bustling streets of distant cities. With each line of code, snapshot, and mile traveled, I weave stories of technology, adventure, and the human spirit. This blog is my canvas, capturing the intersections of a life lived fullyâ€”through the lens of tech and trails. Join me as we explore the world, one code commit and one step at a time, learning and growing with every new sunrise."
